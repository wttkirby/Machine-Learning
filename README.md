This is the [Overview of Machine Learning](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Overview.pdf).

# Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration

This is the [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data%20Exploration/Assignment%201.cpp) and the [paper](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Data%20Exploration/Assignment%201%20Paper.docx) for my data exploration.

# Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models

This is the pdf created for [Regression](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Regression.pdf) and [Classification](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Models/Classification.pdf). In this homework we used Linear and Logistic Regression to process datasets found online.

# Portfolio Component 3: Machine Learning from Scratch

This is a pdf for the [paper](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/Machine%20Learning%20with%20C%2B%2B.pdf) we wrote as a part of this assignment. We also have .cpp files for [Logistic](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/LogisticRegression.cpp) Regression and the [Naive](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20Algorithms%20from%20Scratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) Bayes Model.


# Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity
This is a pdf for the [regression](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Regression.pdf) and the [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Regression.Rmd), [classification](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Classification.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Classification.Rmd), [clustering](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Clustering.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Clustering.Rmd), and dimensionality [reduction](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Searching%20for%20Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.Rmd).

# Portfolio Component 5: Kernel and Ensemble Methods

This is the notebook for [classification](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods/Classification.Rmd), [regression](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods/Regression.Rmd), and [other](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods/Ensemble.Rmd) ensemble methods. There are also [pdfs](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods) and a [paper](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kernel%20and%20Ensemble%20Methods/Kernel_and_Ensemble_Methods_NarrativeDoc.pdf).

# Portfolio Component 6: Machine Learning with SKLearn

This is the [pdf](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20with%20SKLearn/Portfolio_Assignment_ML_with_sklearn.pdf) generated for this assignment as well as the [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/ML%20with%20SKLearn/Portfolio_Assignment_ML_with_sklearn.ipynb).

# Portfolio Component 7: Image Classification

This is the [code](https://github.com/wttkirby/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Image%20Classification/pre-processed-snake-images-update.ipynb).
